## Reflection
The goal of developing this app was to allow me to solidify, as well as put to use, everything I had learned about React JS.

+ Challenges I Faced
    + Listing/fetching and using fetched data
    + Finding the optimal way to pass data to components
    + Writing and running tests

+ Future Improvements
    + Better organization of components and file
    + Better flow of components and data
    + Improve efficiency of using states and context
    + Incorporate Redux where possible
    + Modal operation for adding and editing entries?
    + Make the application responsive
    
With more practice, I hope to write cleaner code as well.
